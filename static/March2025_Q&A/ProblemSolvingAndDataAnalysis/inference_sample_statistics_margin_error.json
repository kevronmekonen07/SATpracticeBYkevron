  "answer": "A) Plausible values for the average weight of all boxes of oranges filled by the company are between 22.91 pounds and 23.29 pounds.",
  "explanation": "Choice A is correct. It's given that the estimate for the average weight of all boxes of oranges filled by the company in an 8-hour period is 23.1 pounds, with an associated margin of error of 0.19 pounds. It follows that plausible values for this average weight are between 23.1 - 0.19 pounds and 23.1 + 0.19 pounds. Therefore, plausible values for the average weight of all boxes of oranges filled by the company are between 22.91 pounds and 23.29 pounds. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."

  "answer": "A) It is between $4.15 and $4.31.",
  "explanation": "Choice A is correct. It's given that the mean price of a carton of grape tomatoes in Utah was estimated to be $4.23, with an associated margin of error of $0.08. It follows that plausible values for this mean price are between $4.23 - $0.08 and $4.23 + $0.08. Therefore, it's plausible that the mean price of a carton of grape tomatoes for all locations that sell this product in Utah is between $4.15 and $4.31. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."
