  "explanation": "The correct answer is 5. For the graph shown, x represents time, in minutes, and y represents temperature, in degrees Celsius (°C). Therefore, the average rate of change, in °C per minute, of the recorded temperature of the air in the chamber between two x-values is the difference in the corresponding y-values divided by the difference in the x-values. The graph shows that at x = 5, the corresponding y-value is 14. The graph also shows that at x = 7, the corresponding y-value is 24. It follows that the average rate of change, in °C per minute, from x = 5 to x = 7 is equivalent to 10/2 or 5. 24-14/7-5 which is equivalent to 10/2, or 5."

  "answer": "A) y = x + 3.4",
  "explanation": "Choice A is correct. The line of best fit shown has a positive slope and intersects the y-axis at a positive y-value. The graph of an equation of the form y = mx + b, where m and b are constants, has a slope of m and intersects the y-axis at a y-value of b. Of the given choices, only y = x + 3.4 represents a line that has a positive slope, 1, and intersects the y-axis at a positive y-value, 3.4. Choice B is incorrect. This equation represents a line that intersects the y-axis at a negative y-value, not a positive y-value. Choice C is incorrect. This equation represents a line that has a negative slope, not a positive slope. Choice D is incorrect. This equation represents a line that has a negative slope, not a positive slope, and intersects the y-axis at a negative y-value, not a positive y-value."

  "explanation": "Choice D is correct. A line in the xy-plane that passes through the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) has a slope of (y2-y1)/(x2-x1). The line of best fit shown passes approximately through the points (1,3.3) and (7, 14.5). It follows that the slope of this best fit line is approximately (14.5-3.3)/(7-1), which is equivalent to 11.2/6, or approximately 1.87. Therefore, of the given choices, 2 is closest to the slope of the line of best fit shown. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."

  "answer": "B) 35",
  "explanation": "Choice B is correct. In the given scatterplot, the x-values represent the distance above sea level, in feet, and the y-values represent the temperature, in °F. The point on the line of best fit with an x-value of 4,000 has a corresponding y-value of 35. Therefore, at a distance of 4,000 feet above sea level, the temperature predicted by the line of best fit is 35°F. Choice A is incorrect. This is the temperature, in °F, predicted by the line of best fit at a distance of 0 feet above sea level. Choice C is incorrect. This is the measured temperature, in °F, at a distance of 6,000 feet above sea level. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."

The line of best fit shown passes approximately through the points (0, 14) and (13, 0). It follows that the slope of this line of best fit is approximately (0 - 14) / (13 - 0) or -14/13.
