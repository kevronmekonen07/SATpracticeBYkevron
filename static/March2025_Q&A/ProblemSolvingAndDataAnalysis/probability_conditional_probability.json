  "answer": "D) 107/135",
  "explanation": "Choice D is correct. If a member of the organization is selected at random, the probability that the selected member is at least 40 years old is equal to the number of members who are at least 40 years old divided by the total number of members. According to the table, there are a total of 135 members of the organization, and 107 of these members are at least 40 years old. Therefore, the probability that the selected member is at least 40 years old is 107/135. Choice A is incorrect. This is the probability that the selected member is less than 40 years old. Choice B is incorrect. This is the probability that the selected member lives east of the river. Choice C is incorrect. This is the probability that the selected member lives west of the river."

  "answer": "B) 1/3",
  "explanation": "Choice B is correct. The probability of selecting a positive number is the number of positive numbers in the data set divided by the total number of numbers in the data set. There is 1 positive number in this data set. There are 3 total numbers in this data set. Thus, if a number from this data set is selected at random, the probability of selecting a positive number is 1/3. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect. This is the probability of selecting a negative number from this data set. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."
